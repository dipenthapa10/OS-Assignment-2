## Program Description

This program implements the Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance in an operating system to determine whether
a system is in a safe or unsafe state based on the allocation of resources to processes. 
The algorithm uses the Allocation, Max, Need, and Available resource vectors to check if all
processes can finish in some order without leading to deadlock.

Here, this programs reads the Available resources, the allocation matrix  and the max matrix from an input.txt file .
It then calculates the Need matrix using
Need = Max - Allocation

## Algorithm Overview 

Here, the banker algorithm is used which is a resource allocaiton and deadlock avoidance algorithm. Here, it ensures
that the resource allocated to processes never leads to a deadlock situation by carefully checking for
"safe states" before granting resource requests.

It is used for:
- to ensure system never enter unsafe state 
- to allow maximum resource utilization while maintaining safety
- it provides guaranteed safe execution sequences

How it works:
So, here the program starts by reading information from the given input file i.e. input.txt.
This includes the number of resources that are currenlty available, where the resouces already
givecn to each process, and the maximum resources each process may need to finish it. Using all
this information provided to it after that the program calculates how many more resources each 
process still need. Where this is called Need.

Then after calculating the need , the program checks the system step by step. It looks for any 
more process that can finish its work with the currenlty available resources. When it finds 
such a process , here it assumes that process completes its task and returns all the resources 
it was holding back to the available.

After that the program repeats this process, checking which processes can now finsih with 
the newly available resouces. It continues this cycle until either all processes have finsihed
which means wheather the system is safe or it reaches some point where some processes cannot 
finish meaning the system is unsafe.

Now, finally the program displays whether the system is in a safe state and shows the order 
in which processes can safely execute if a safe sequence exists.

And for this assignment it shows the system is safe and the the safe sequence it produces is:
P3 → P4 → P1 → P2 → P0.
