# OS Assignment 2

## Program Description

This program implements the Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance in an operating system to determine whether a system is in a safe or unsafe state based on the allocation of resources to processes.
The algorithm uses the Allocation, Max, Need, and Available resource vectors to check if all processes can finish in some order without leading to deadlock.

## File List:

main.cpp — C++ source code implementing the Banker’s Algorithm

input.txt — Input data file containing Available, Allocation, and Max matrices


## Usage Guide:
- Make sure main.cpp and input.txt are in the same directory.
- Compile the program using the following command:
